                <p>I currently live in Houston, Texas and work at the <a class="grey-link" href="https://www.texaspolicylab.org/">Texas Policy Lab</a> (TPL) at Rice University. At TPL,
                    I work in our Health, Early Child Care, and Criminal Justice policy areas. Prior to my work at TPL, I worked at <a class="grey-link" href="https://www.mathematica.org/">Mathematica Policy Research</a>
                    in their Healthcare division.</p>
                <p>Originally, I'm from Bainbridge Island, Washington, but have lived in four states in the US and Melbourne, Australia. I identify as a member of the LGBTQ+ community and
                     am very interested in data issues such as privacy and data collection that are particularly sensitive to this community. 
                </p>
                <p>I graduated from Wesleyan University with a BA in Economics and a minor in data analytics in 2017. I began programming at 
                    Wesleyan 6 years ago and have touched code almost every day since. Prior to attending Wesleyan University, I attended Whitman 
                    College for a year.
                </p>
                <p>In my spare time I throw ceramics on the wheel, play ultimate frisbee, and try to get outside as much as possible. I've had a love of art my whole life.</p>

            <p>I currently live in Houston, Texas and work at the Texas Policy Lab at Rice University. I'm from Bainbridge Island, Washington but I've been fortunate to have experienced living in several different places in the US including: Hawaii, Eastern Washington, and Connecticut. 
            </p>
            <p>I graduated from Wesleyan University with a degree in Economics and a minor in data analytics in 2017. 
            </p>
            <p>In my spare time I throw ceramics on the wheel, play ultimate frisbee, and try to get outside as much as possible. I've had a love of art my whole life.</p>

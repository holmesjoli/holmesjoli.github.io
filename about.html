                <p>My interest in data science and analytics started as an undergraduate at Wesleyan University. I never planned to fall in love with data, but working in Wesleyan University's Quantitative Analysis Center (QAC) one summer changed everything. I became fascinated with how data, especially data from unusual sources, could be used in traditional academic research. Wesleyan did not just teach me how to code and use statistical methods, but how to think critically and apply an interdisciplinary lens to all research projects.</p>
                <p>Building models and visualizing data felt like magic — having a strong analytic skill set was so powerful. It was not until the end of my senior year that I started to reflect on what that power really meant and became aware of another truth — how harmful algorithms could be. I became wary of pursuing a job in a technology field and decided to use my skill set in a field that felt more ethical — policy research.</p>
                <p>My first position was at Mathematica Policy Research. At Mathematica, I worked on traditional public policy evaluations, built web applications in R, and automated web testing in Python. However, at Mathematica, the projects were so high-level that I felt disconnected from the policy that we were shaping. This led me to my position as a data scientist at the <a class="grey-link" href="https://www.texaspolicylab.org/">Texas Policy Lab</a> at Rice University in Houston, Texas. I work in our Health, Early Child Care, and Criminal Justice policy areas at Texas Policy Lab. I frequently develop web applications to help our government partners visualize trends in the data. Currently, I am a graduate student at Northeastern University studying Information Design and Data Visualization.</p>
                <p>Originally, I'm from Bainbridge Island, Washington, but have lived in four states in the US and Melbourne, Australia. I identify as a member of the LGBTQ+ community and am very interested in data issues such as privacy and data collection that are particularly sensitive to this community. I graduated from Wesleyan University with a Bachelors of Arts in Economics and a minor in Data Analytics in 2017.</p>
                <p>In my spare time I throw ceramics on the wheel, play ultimate frisbee, and try to get outside as much as possible. I've had a love of art my whole life.</p> <p>Download my resume <a class = "grey-link" href="resume/Joli Holmes resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>

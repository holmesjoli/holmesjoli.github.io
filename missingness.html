            <p>Criminal justice research frequently relies on administrative data from
            law enforcement agencies. Law enforcement agencies are widely recognized to have
            data which may be biased or can easily be interpreted in a biased way. For example, 
            the FBI reports on different types of crime in the UCR (Uniform Crime Reporting). In 2019,
            the FBI reported 29,296 white people were arrested for marijuana possession in Texas. The same year 13,259 Black people were 
            arrested for marijuana possession in Texas. Using, 2018 Census estimates, there was 1 arrest for every 
            779 white people in Texas, compared to 1 arrest for every 282 Black people in Texas. 
            The data clearly seem to indicate that Black people use more marijuana than white people, resulting in 
            higher arrest rate.</p>
            <p>However, research by the <a class="grey-link" href="https://www.aclu.org/news/criminal-law-reform/a-tale-of-two-countries-racially-targeted-arrests-in-the-era-of-marijuana-reform/">ACLU</a>
            indicates that Black and white people use marijuana are relatively the same rate. The difference
            lies not in differences in criminal behavior, but in the policing of criminal behavior.</p>
            <p>The beaded graphic depicts arrest rates for marijuana possession in white communities compared to 
            Black communities. The graph's intention is to show systemic missingness which exists in our criminal systems data.
            Missingness is a common issue in data analysis, but the idea of system-level missingness often goes unaddressed. The 
            imputed bar in the first image indicates how many white people would have been arrested if white communities were 
            policed at a similar rate as Black communities.</p>
            <p>
            Communities of color are policed at much higher rates than white 
            communities and the rise in predictive policing has augmented this trend. Although 
            sociotechnical systems may appear to be neutral and unbiased, they are often trained on 
            data which is biased. For example, when communities of color are policed more than white 
            communities, people of color end up in the criminal justice system at much higher rates. 
            Predictive policing algorithms are trained on data which have been collected in the past. 
            Since people of color and neighborhoods of color appear with greater frequency in the training data, 
            predictive algorithms predict that crime will occur with greater frequencies in communities 
            of color which then perpetuates the over-policing of communities of color.</p>

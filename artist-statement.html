        <h3>Artist statement</h3>
        <p>Data are socially constructed, but due to their quantitative nature, they are frequently accepted 
          as unbiased, neutral, and true. However, social contruction necessitates that certain values will be
          encoded in the data, in the collection process, in their general use. My goal as an artist is to
          complicate the notion of neutrality as it applies to data and technology more generally. 
        </p>
        <p>Much of my interest the data being perceived as neutral stems from my work in social policy research.
          Administrative data is frequently used in policy research because it is already collected and managed by
          government agencies. The alternative way to access data for research is through primary data collection, 
          which can be costly in time and resources. However, one large disadvantage of using administrative data is 
          that is is not generally collected for research and may therefore be biased. 
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <div class="tab">
          <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'encoded-values')">Encoded Values</button>
          <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'black-data')">Black Data</button>
        </div>
        <div id="encoded-values" class="tabcontent">
          <p>There are countless examples of how societal values (e.g. heteronormativity, white supremacy, abelism)
            become encoded in sociotechnical systems. One that I came across in my recent work, in government data used by the 
            youth criminal justice system, was the treatment of race and ethnicity as the same variable. The categories encoded 
            in the variable were: White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, Other. The categorization of Hispanic in the race variable 
            as separate than White or Black indicates the data collectors were interested in capturing data on brown-Hispanic youth,
            but not White-Hispanic or Black-Hispanic youth.</p>
          <p>Mistakes such as the example mentioned above are often seen as technological glitches instead of the physical hardcoding
            of societal values into data systems. Science and technology scholar, Ruha Benjamin writes about this phenomenon in her 
            book <em>Race After Technology</em> and coins the term the New Jim Code when this phenomenon is applied to racial 
            justice issues. Design justice scholar Sasha Costanza-Chock also writes extensively about this phenomenon in her book 
            <em>Design Justice</em> as it applies to trans, heteronormativity, settler colonialism, and abelism.

        <div id="black-data" class="tabcontent">
          <p>Criminal justice research frequently relies on data administrative data from
            law enforcement agencies. Law enforcement agencies are widely recognized to have
            data which may be biased or can easily be interpreted in a biased way. For example, 
            the FBI reports on different types of crime in the UCR (Uniform Crime Reporting). In 2019,
            the FBI reported 29,296 white people were arrested for marijuana possession. 13,259 Black people were 
            arrested for the same crime. Using, 2018 census estimates, there was 1 arrest for every 
            779 white people in Texas, compared to 1 arrest for every 282 Black people in Texas. 
            The data clearly seem to indicate that Black people use more marijuana than white people, resulting in 
            higher arrest rate.
          </p>
          <p>However, research by the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/criminal-law-reform/a-tale-of-two-countries-racially-targeted-arrests-in-the-era-of-marijuana-reform/">ACLU</a>
            indicates that Black and white people used marijuana are relatively the same rate. The difference
            in the law enforcement database lies not differences in criminal behavior, but in the policing of
            criminal behavior.

            <h3>Data and research background</h3>
            <p>I graduated from Wesleyan University with a Bachelors of Arts in Economics and
                minor in data analytics. At Wesleyan I was a TA for the data visualization class.
                Since then, I've worked as a data scientist in social policy research.
                I've loved working in policy research because it feels like my work positively
                impacts my community through data-informed decisions. Most of my programming experience
                is in programming languages: R and Python. As a data scientist, much of the work I do
                is visual in nature and it's my favorite part of the work that I do. I love being
                able to take a complex system or analysis and turn it into something that's more interpretable.
                However, as a data scientist my training in visualization has been primarily technical and 
                not as theoretical.

                <p>Art has always been the subject that I connected the most with. There wasn't a semester in middle school or high school where I wasn't in an art class. I started throwing on the wheel when I was 12 years old and have continue to throw at a local studio in my spare time. I've also engage in many other sectors of traditionally seen as craft such as beading and fiber arts, knitting and sewing. While I don't come from a traditional studio background, I was did have the opportunity to take two art classes at Wesleyan: Drawing I and Digital Arts. </p>

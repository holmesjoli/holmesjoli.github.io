        <p>While I do not come from a traditional academic arts background, I am a very active creator. Frequently, the mediums that 
          Iâ€™m most interested in working with and exploring are those not often recognized as "high arts" such as fiber arts, ceramics, 
          and web design. Art has always been the subject that I connect with the most. I started throwing on the wheel 
          when I was 12 years old and have continued to throw since.</p>
        <h3>Research Interests</h3>
        <p>Much of my portfolio is dedicated to challenging the idea that quantitative data and technology are neutral and 
          objective. Data are socially constructed, but due to their quantitative nature, they are frequently accepted as unbiased,
          neutral, and true. However, social construction necessitates that certain values will be encoded in the data, in the 
          collection process, and in their general use. My goal as an artist is to complicate the notion of neutrality as it 
          applies to data and technology. 
        </p>
        <p>Much of my interest in data stems from my work in social policy research. Administrative data are frequently used in 
          policy research because the data are already collected and managed by government agencies. The alternative way to access data 
          for research is through primary data collection, which can be costly in time and resources. However, one large disadvantage 
          of using administrative data is that it is not generally collected for research and may therefore be biased.

            <h3>Data and research background</h3>
            <p>I graduated from Wesleyan University with a Bachelors of Arts in Economics and a minor in Data Analytics. At Wesleyan, 
              I was a TA in the data visualization class. Since then, I've worked as a data scientist in social policy research.
              I love working in policy research because my work positively impacts my community through data-informed 
              decisions. Most of my programming experience is in R and Python. As a data scientist, much of the work I do
              is visual in nature and it's my favorite part of the work that I do. I love being able to take a complex system or analysis 
              and turn it into something that is more interpretable.

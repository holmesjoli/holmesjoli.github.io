                <h4>Design Brief</h4>
                <p>Design a web page that features a visualization made with D3 that features both a data update and at least one form of interactivity.</p>
                <h4>Research</h4>
                <p>Transportation maps have changed a lot over the last 100 years due to Harry Beck. Beck was a mechanical draughtsman who redesigned the London Underground Railroad Map in the 1930s. Until that time, the two primary marks used in most transportation diagrams, points, and lines, encoded geographic information about where the stops were relative to the other stops. Position is often an influential visual variable used to communicate quantitative information.</p>
                <p>However, Beck realized that most diagram users didn't need to know how far stops were from each other geographically from a functional perspective. Users needed to know which stop was next and how they could transfer between trains to get to their final destination. Mapping the stations geographically led to crowding information in the center of the map, resulting in ambiguity as to which stations the names belonged.</p>

        <h3>Artist statement</h3>
        <p>My personal research interests lie in data ethics issues and technology design. Data are socially constructed, but it's easy to forget that. Technology is often branded as neutral and objective, when in reality data are messy and they are collected by systems which humans created. More and more algorithms are being deployed as automated decision-making tools. We live in a world which is becoming more and more dominated by automated decision-making machines which rely on algorithms frequently trained on biased data. I want to center my work in the visual/design field on challenging the notion that data and algorithms are neutral and objective. </p>
        <h4>Data and research background</h4>
        <p>I graduated from Wesleyan University with a Bachelors of Arts in Economics and minor in data analytics. At Wesleyan I was a TA for the data visualization class. Since then, I've worked as a data scientist in social policy research. I've loved working in policy research because it feels like my work positively impacts my community through data-informed decisions. Most of my programming experience is in programming languages: R and Python. As a data scientist, much of the work I do is visual in nature and it's my favorite part of the work that I do. I love being able to take a complex system or analysis and turn it into something that's more interpretable. However, as a data scientist my training in visualization has been primarily technical and not as theoretical. </p>
        <h4>Artistic background</h4>

            <p>Art has always been the subject that I connected the most with. There wasn't a semester in middle school or high school where I wasn't in an art class. I started throwing on the wheel when I was 12 years old and have continue to throw at a local studio in my spare time. I've also engage in many other sectors of traditionally seen as craft such as beading and fiber arts, knitting and sewing. While I don't come from a traditional studio background, I was did have the opportunity to take two art classes at Wesleyan: Drawing I and Digital Arts. </p>

            Black data is a term used by Andrew Ferguson in his book The Rise of Big Data Policing. 
            WHAT IS BLACK DATA ...
            </p>
            <p>
            Ferguson details how communities of color are policed at much higher rates than white 
            communities and the rise in predictive policing has augmented this trend. Although 
            sociotechnical systems may appear to be neutral and unbiased, they are often trained on 
            data which is biased. For example, when communities of color are policed more than white 
            communities, people of color end up in the criminal justice system at much higher rates. 
            Predictive policing algorithms are trained on data which have been collected in the past. 
            Since people of color and neighborhoods of color appear with greater frequency in the training data, 
            predictive algorithms predict that crime will occur with greater frequencies in communities 
            of color which then perpetuates the over-policing of communities of color.

            The first image shows the number of arrests in for marijuana possession in Black communities 
            compared to white communities. Research indicates that white people and black people use marijuana 
            at similar rates, but Black people are 3.64 times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession 
            than white people. The imputed bar in the first image indicates how many white people would have been 
            arrested if white communities were policed at a similar rate as Black communities.
